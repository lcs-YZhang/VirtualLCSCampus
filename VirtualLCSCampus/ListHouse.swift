 Through the donations of the Cooper family, Cooper House was built and opened at the beginning of the 2009/2010 school year. Uniquely designed, it was the first residence building on campus to stray from the standard floor plan, providing each student with their own private room as well as a connecting semi-private bathroom. These new features made Cooper House very popular among the students for years to come.
